# Harry Potter Quidditch Game
Created a VR Harry Potter Quidditch game using Unity and custom textures provided by https://www.models-resource.com.
We were given a choice on how to accomplish a final project for our literature class, so we decided with the professor and we were allowed to create a video game!
